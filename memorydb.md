# MemoryDB

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/memorydb/latest/devguide/what-is-memorydb-for-redis.html

MemoryDB is a durable, in-memory database service that delivers ultra-fast performance. It is purpose-built for modern applications with microservices architectures.

MemoryDB is compatible with Redis OSS, a popular open source data store, enabling you to quickly build applications using the same flexible and friendly Redis OSS data structures, APIs, and commands that they already use today. With MemoryDB, all of your data is stored in memory, which enables you to achieve microsecond read and single-digit millisecond write latency and high throughput. MemoryDB also stores data durably across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) using a Multi-AZ transactional log to enable fast failover, database recovery, and node restarts.

Delivering both in-memory performance and Multi-AZ durability, MemoryDB can be used as a high-performance primary database for your microservices applications, eliminating the need to separately manage both a cache and durable database.

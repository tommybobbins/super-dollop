# Quicksight

- QuickSight Enterprise edition fully integrated with the Amazon VPC service. 
- When you register a VPC connection with QuickSight, you can securely connect to data that's available only in your VPC, 
- 1. Data you can reach by IP address 
  2. Data that isn't available on the public internet 
  3. Private databases 
  4. On-premises data

By creating a VPC connection in QuickSight, you're adding an elastic network interface in your VPC. This network interface allows QuickSight to exchange network traffic with a network instance within your VPC. You can provide all of the standard security controls for this network traffic, as you do with other traffic in your VPC. Route tables, network access control lists (ACLs), subnets, and security groups settings all apply to network traffic to and from QuickSight in the same way that they apply to traffic between other instances in your VPC.

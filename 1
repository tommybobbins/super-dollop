## Gotchas

- Records without a health check are always considered healthy. If no record is healthy, all records are deemed to be healthy - If a record in a group of records that have the same name and type doesn't have an associated health check, Route 53 always considers it healthy and always includes it among possible responses to a query.
- If none of the records in a group of records are healthy, Route 53 needs to return something in response to DNS queries, but it has no basis for choosing one record over another. In this circumstance, Route 53 considers all the records in the group to be healthy and selects one based on the routing policy and on the values that you specify for each record.
- If you're creating failover records in a private hosted zone, you must assign a public IP address to an instance in the VPC to check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address
- Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to an instance in the VPC.
- You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the data stream for the alarm.

## Redshift and OLAP Use Cases.



## Redshift backups:

Create a snapshot copy grant in the destination Region for a KMS key in the destination Region. Configure Redshift cross-Region snapshots in the source Region
To copy snapshots for AWS KMSâ€“encrypted clusters to another AWS Region, you need to create a grant for Redshift to use a KMS customer master key (CMK) in the destination AWS Region. Then choose that grant when you enable copying of snapshots in the source AWS Region. You cannot use a KMS key from the source Region as AWS KMS keys are specific to an AWS Region.

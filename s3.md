# Bucket Policies and ACLs

When you apply the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership to disable ACLs, you automatically own and take full control over every object in the bucket without taking any additional actions. After you apply this setting there are 3 changes:

- All bucket ACLs and object ACLs are disabled, giving full access to you as the bucket owner. When you perform a read ACL request on your bucket or object you'll see that full access is given only to the bucket owner.
- You, as the bucket owner, automatically own and have full control over every object in your bucket.
- AACLs no longer affect access permissions to your bucket. As a result, access control for your data is based on policies, such as IAM policies, S3 bucket policies, VPC endpoint policies and Org. SCPs.

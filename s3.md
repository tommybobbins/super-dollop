# Bucket Policies and ACLs

When you apply the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership to disable ACLs, you automatically own and take full control over every object in the bucket without taking any additional actions. After you apply this setting there are 3 changes:

- All bucket ACLs and object ACLs are disabled, giving full access to you as the bucket owner. When you perform a read ACL request on your bucket or object you'll see that full access is given only to the bucket owner.
- You, as the bucket owner, automatically own and have full control over every object in your bucket.
- AACLs no longer affect access permissions to your bucket. As a result, access control for your data is based on policies, such as IAM policies, S3 bucket policies, VPC endpoint policies and Org. SCPs.

kms:GenerateDataKey

GenerateDataKey returns a unique symmetric data key for use outside of AWS KMS. This operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key and a copy that is encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key that you specify. The bytes in the plaintext key are random; they are not related to the caller or the KMS key. You can use the plaintext key to encrypt your data outside of AWS KMS and store the encrypted data key with the encrypted data.

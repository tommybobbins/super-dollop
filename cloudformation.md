# CloudFormation

Infrastructure patterns are defined in a template file using code (json or yaml). Cloudformation builds infrastructure according to the template.

- Infrastructure provisioned consistently.
- Fewer mistakes, human error.
- Reusable templates (define once, keep re-using).
- Pay for the resources provisioned.
- Allows rollback once complete.
- Upload to CF directly or S3 and point CF to template in S3.
- Logical ID is used to reference resources within the template.
- Automatic rollback on error is enabled by default.
- Stacksets : *Multiple accounts and regions*
- Admin account for stacks and stacksets.
- Nested stacks, reference other templates (e.g. for load balancer).

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|Templates|JSON or YAML text described by the template and created, updated and deleted as a single unit.|
|Stacks|The entire environment described by the template and created, updated and deleted as a single unit|
|StackSets|AWS CloudFormation Stacksets extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to create, update and delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions within a single operation.|
|Change Sets|A summary of proposed changes. Preview mode.|

## Change Sets

- Direct update - submit changes and AWS immediately deploys.
- Change sets - preview the changes AWS will make and decide whether to apply or not.

## Service Catalog

AWS Service Catalog, create and manage approved catalogs of IT services. It enables users to quickly deploy only the approved IT services they need.

- Catalog Admin authors templates and creates product. Organise into portfolios.
- Product is added to a portfolio.
- Users/Groups are assigned permissions to a portfolio.
- Constraints are added to the product/portfolio.

### Constraints

- Controls the ways that AWS resources can be deployed.
- Apply limits to products for governance or cost control.
- * Launch constraints * - specify a role for a product in a portfolio. The role is used to provision resources at launch so you can restrict user permissions without impacting users ability to provision products from the catalog.
- * Notification constraints * - enable you to get notifications about stack events using an Amazon SNS topic.
- * Template constraints * - restrict the configuration parameters that are available for the user when launching the product.

### Service Catalog Permissions

- Users don't need permissions, only permissions to access Service Catalog.
- Underlying Service Catalog needs a Role and a Policy to allow it to launch resources.

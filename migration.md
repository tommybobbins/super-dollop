## AWS Application Discovery Service 

Helps you plan your migration to the AWS cloud by collecting usage and configuration data about your on-premises servers. Application Discovery Service is integrated with AWS Migration Hub, which simplifies your migration tracking as it aggregates your migration status information into a single console. You can view the discovered servers, group them into applications, and then track the migration status of each application from the Migration Hub console in your home region.


## AWS Migration Hub (Migration Hub) 

Provides a single place to discover your existing servers, plan migrations, and track the status of each application migration. The Migration Hub provides visibility into your application portfolio and streamlines planning and tracking. You can visualize the connections and the status of the servers and databases that make up each of the applications you are migrating, regardless of which migration tool you are using. Migration Hub gives you the choice to start migrating right away and group servers while migration is underway or to first discover servers and then group them into applications.
